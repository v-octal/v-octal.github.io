    <h1>The Polaroids on our Memories</h1>
    <time>15 June, 2020</time>

    <p>
        One can think of light as a wave traveling through time and space.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since light is an electromagnetic wave, it has both electric and magnetic components that are perpendicular to
        each other. If the electric component lies in one plane and the magnetic component in another, there are
        infinite possible
        ways they can be arranged in three dimensions. This is what we call unpolarized light. Most of the light we see
        around us
        is unpolarized.
    </p>

    <p>
        But what if we somehow allow only one of these infinite ways in a light ray? That particular light ray is then
        called polarized. Thin sheets of plastic that allow us to do this are called polarizers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Similar to polarized light, our memories are also polarized versions of reality. If we draw an analogy:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Reality/truth is the unpolarized light</li>
        <li>Memory is the polarized light</li>
        <li>We, the individual, and our understanding of the world at the moment of observing memories is the polaroid
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        As we evolve and change as individuals, we keep stacking these polaroids on our memories. Depending upon the
        polaroid,
        we may or may not remember a memory fondly. If we are "happy," everything seems wonderful—even difficult
        memories seem
        worth it or become just humorous incidents. On the other hand, if we are "unhappy," everything seems gloomy, and
        we
        just want to revert to our previous "happy" states.
    </p>

    <p>
        But just like a plastic polaroid sheet blocks light, our current and previous states also block the truth. As
        soon as
        the first polaroid is placed in front of memory, the truth is lost, and there's no way to get it back. Actually,
        most
        of the truth is lost, with only a fragment remaining. That's not to say it's an outright lie—it's just a memory,
        and
        that's all it is. And that is how we should observe it; we should not let this memory cloud our present.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike memories, truth is always present in the present, if we choose to see it. We should cherish this. Truth
        is not
        easy, it's not hard—it's just truth, and it may not be for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        The way we perceive our past is constantly changing as we grow. What once seemed like a devastating failure
        might later
        appear as a necessary stepping stone. A cherished memory might later reveal itself as something more complex
        when viewed
        through the lens of greater life experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is why two people can experience the same event yet walk away with completely different memories. Their
        individual
        polaroids—their unique perspectives, past experiences, and current emotional states—filter the reality
        differently.
    </p>

    <p>
        Perhaps the art of living well involves recognizing when we're viewing our memories through particularly
        distorted
        polaroids. When we're at our lowest, our memories might appear unnecessarily dark. When we're at our highest, we
        might
        romanticize difficult periods that shouldn't be repeated.
    </p>

    <p>
        After all, <em>not everyone can stare into the sun without polaroids</em>.
