    <h1>Inevitable</h1>
    <time>15 October, 2022</time>

    <p>
        Last night, I found a dead bug in the toilet bowl when I returned home after cycling. I didn't think much of it
        and simply flushed it away. The night proceeded routinely, and finally, I went to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the middle of the night, I woke up from a dream. The dream was still on my mind, so I couldn't fall back
        asleep. I drank some water and went to the washroom. To my surprise, the bug was still there.
    </p>

    <p>
        I flushed it again. But this time, I watched the bug go down the drain. Remarkably, it was somehow still there.
        Upon closer inspection, I discovered that it wasn't dead at all. It was upside down with its wings stuck in the
        water. I wasn't sure what to do. Then I realized this little creature had been stuck there for about 8-10 hours,
        struggling to survive, refusing to give up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Eight to ten hours for a bug is a significant portion of its life, considering most bugs' lifespans are less
        than a year. In human terms, it would be equivalent to struggling for about a month. I was impressed by its
        resilience and thought this fighter deserved a second chance.
    </p>

    <p>
        I went out, picked up a small stick, carefully lifted it out of the water, and placed it at the window—likely
        the entry point from which it had come. As I was walking away, I heard a gentle thud followed by a buzz.
    </p>

    <p>
        The bug was lying on the floor, again upside down. Its wings were wet, preventing it from flying. I realized
        the wings would never dry indoors, and it would never make it out on its own. So, I decided to pick it up and
        escort it outside. I carried it outdoors only to realize that its wings were still too wet for flight. At that
        point, I was fully committed to saving this tiny life.
    </p>

    <p>
        I brought it back inside, placed it on the floor of my hall, turned on the fans and lights, and watched it for
        a few minutes. It was flapping its wings, slowly moving around, and doing much better than before. Satisfied
        with its progress, I decided it was time to return to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I turned around, I heard a swish. I turned back, and to my confusion, the bug had disappeared. Had it been
        faking its condition all along? Or had it miraculously recovered? But I hadn't seen it fly away, and there was
        no obvious exit. Puzzled, I looked around but couldn't find the bug.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I did find was a gecko. And then it clicked. I wished I was wrong, but there it was—the bug's wings
        peeking out from the gecko's mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nature had taken its course. Despite all my efforts to save the bug, it had met its inevitable fate. I'm still
        not sure how I feel about this incident.
