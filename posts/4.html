    <h1>Being a mentor at Udacity</h1>
    <time>10 July, 2019</time>

    <p>
        A few days ago, the last student from my first cohort in the Virtual Reality Nanodegree graduated, resulting in 
        the completion of my cohort with a 100% success rate. Being a student of the course myself, I knew the importance 
        of a good mentor. I received great mentorship from my mentor during the nanodegree, and now it was my turn to help others.
    </p>

    <p>
        My cohort started in the middle of March. As part of my mentorship program, I had to give weekly webinars on topics 
        relevant to the course. I also had to provide one-on-one help and track the progress of the students. Since I knew 
        everything in the course plus more, I thought this was going to be easy. But I quickly found out that it wasn't.

    <p>
        When I was preparing for my webinars, I discovered that while it's easy to understand something yourself, it's much 
        more difficult to make someone else understand it. Normally when I try to understand something, I relate it to 
        something I already know. This helps me build simple analogies. These analogies are helpful only for me or someone 
        like me. But when you're teaching to a general audience, you have to create analogies that resonate with everyone. 
        The things common among everyone are really simple, everyday things. So, when teaching complex concepts, breaking 
        them down and relating them to everyday experiences is essential.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from webinars, solving one-on-one queries is sometimes fun and sometimes not. When these queries turn me into 
        a student again and require me to do research, I love it. But sometimes errors occur because a student didn't follow 
        the process correctly, and in these cases, narrowing down the problem can be tricky, though it helps me learn too.

        Finally, managing and ensuring that no one falls behind is probably the greatest challenge. Everyone hits several 
        roadblocks during their learning process. These roadblocks differ for each student and can greatly vary in difficulty. 
        The most important thing is making sure students don't lose their motivation, curiosity, and drive. Overall, the 
        experience has been great. I've learned several new things and interacted with amazing students. I'm now mentoring 
        other cohorts, constantly learningâ€”and I love it.
