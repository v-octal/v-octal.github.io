    <h1>Left-wing vs Right-wing</h1>
    <time>13 October, 2020</time>

    <p>
        When I started playing football properly, my first position was on the left-wing. I played as a left-winger or
        attacking left midfielder. When I played on the left, I was usually trying to cut inside and take on the entire
        opposition on my own. But as I started playing with better players, I soon realized that I couldn't do it alone.
        Football is a team game, after all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I was right-footed, I couldn't cross effectively from the left-wing, so I switched to the right-wing. I
        found the transition difficult at first because the approach was completely different. Instead of cutting inside,
        I needed to focus on delivering crosses and working the touchline. I played on the right for a while, but then I
        realized that I wasn't really suited to being an attacker.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, I moved to the right side of the defense and started playing as a right-back. I tried this position for a few
        games but still didn't feel comfortable. The constant running up and down the flank was exhausting, and I found
        myself more interested in the defensive aspects than joining the attack.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next, I shifted to center-back. However, I quickly discovered that the center-back position was similar to the
        striker position in one crucial way: in both roles, you're less involved in the general flow of the game, but you
        suffer the consequences of mistakes the most. One defensive lapse could lead to a goal, just as one missed
        opportunity for a striker could cost the match.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, I moved to the center defensive midfielder position, commonly known as CDM. When my team plays with two
        defensive midfielders, I prefer to position myself on the right side. In this role, I'm much more involved in the
        game, and my primary responsibility is to stop opposition attacks before they become dangerous. <strong>If the
        opposition is attacking from their left, I defend from the right, and if the opposition is attacking from their
        right, I defend from the left.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        There's a famous quote by Vicente del Bosque about Sergio Busquets, one of the greatest CDMs of all time:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "If you watch the whole game, you won't see Busquets—but watch Busquets, and you will see the whole game."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This perfectly captures the essence of the position. A center defensive midfielder keeps the entire system
        stable, operating in the shadows while enabling the more flashy players to shine. Sometimes I wish that everybody
        approached life like a CDM—with patience, awareness, and a willingness to do the unglamorous work that makes
        everything else possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I also recognize that a functioning system requires left and right-wing attackers and defenders. Without
        these more specialized roles, the system becomes stagnant and boring. The wingers provide width, creativity, and
        excitement. The full-backs offer support in both defense and attack. The center-backs provide security and
        organization. The strikers deliver the goals that win matches.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet without a CDM—without someone willing to maintain balance, to cover spaces, to connect defense and
        attack—the entire system crumbles. In football as in life, it's often the least visible contributions that
        provide the foundation for everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
        My journey through different positions taught me something valuable: finding your natural role isn't about
        glamour or recognition—it's about discovering where your strengths can best serve the collective. For me, that
        place was in the heart of midfield, protecting my teammates and connecting the play. Where's yours?
