        <p>
            Memories flashing of a perfect time,<br>
            When the water was wine<br>
            There wasn't a sickness without a cure<br>
            because the air was so pure,
        </p>

        <p>
            The sun was always shining bright,<br>
            the nights were full of majestic moonlight<br>
            Neither horizon nor peaks could be seen,<br>
            So, no one was chasing a pipedream
        </p>

        <p>
            The cities were small, The hearts were big,<br>
            Every season was spring<br>
            The buildings were distant, The people were close,<br>
            Every day was grandiose<br>
            Connections were alike yet original,<br>
            It was the time when civilization reached its pinnacle
        </p>

        <p>
            Our perceptions may very well be far apart<br>
            After all, All I did was observe from afar<br>
            I wish I did,<br>
            But it was a time I never lived
        </p>
