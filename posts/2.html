    <h1>The Reality</h1>
    <time>17 June, 2017</time>

    <p>As I go to bed late at night,<br>
    deep thoughts in my head ignite.<br>
    I question myself what is the reality?<br>
    As I go deeper into my thoughts, I explore my spirituality.</p>

    <p>Perplexed! I roll over onto my chest,<br>
    Logic and science don't really answer my quest.<br>
    And I know God and religion is just an excuse and obsession,<br>
    it's a dead-end, it has no progression.</p>

    <p>Being an optimist, I don't give up just yet,<br>
    but a small voice in the head says why do you fret?<br>
    Dwelling further, I ask myself what if all this is a lie?<br>
    So should I quit everything and die?</p>

    <p>That small voice comes ringing out again, this time bigger in size<br>
    and says don't be a fool, act wise.<br>
    Then I wonder what could possibly be the meaning of life?<br>
    That voice, this time even bigger, comes out in strife</p>

    <p>and says some things are best left unexplained.<br>
    Being a rationalist, I'm not easily tamed<br>
    but the thought of going even deeper into the dark corners of my brain,<br>
    made me accept that all of this is in vain</p>

    <p>And as I succumbed to that voice, I see the daylight<br>
    that the voice may just be right,<br>
    maybe not in its logic but certainly in its intent<br>
    as a life lived happily is a life well spent.</p>
